<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>
Fortnite is a first person Battle Royale shooting game where you start out in a Bus in the sky, and then you have to jump out of it and land in many different places. In those places, there are chests, guns, and suplies that you can pick up to kill other people. You also spawn with an axe so you can break materials to build forts as a protection from other players.
